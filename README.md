## Purpose: 
Build weighted and undirected graphs.

## About:
Graph is a collection of vertexes which can be connected with edges. This assignment includes graph class(WGraph_DS) with inner node class (NodeInfo)
and graphs algorithms class (WGraph_Algo).

#### **WGraph_DS:**
Build a graph. Some of the methods includes adding node to a graph, connecting two nodes, etc.

#### **NodeInfo:**
 Build a node that support the graph.

#### **WGraph_Algo:**
Contains general more complex methods, like distance between nodes, if graph is connected and more.
